## FPGA vendor specific components

This folder contains FPGA specific components (e.g., memory components) for different vendors.

For example, if you want to use the FPGa optimized version of the DMEM, please use the file from the
accordinf FPGA vendor folder instead of the original file from the rtl\core folder.
